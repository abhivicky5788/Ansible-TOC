ansible Inventory Aliases

An alias helps you define name for a host. In our example, we’ve specified IP addresses of the hosts in our inventory file. If we’d like to ping only one system, we’ll have to do:

$ ansible -m ping 172.29.33.22
That doesn’t look cool. Let’s set aliases for our two hosts:

$ cat /etc/ansible/hosts
[servers]
host1 ansible_host=172.29.33.22
host2 ansible_host=172.29.33.23
And now we can simply do:

$ ansible -m ping host1
